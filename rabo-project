Hi All,
Please find below the details of the assignment. Split yourselves into 3 groups and 2 groups work on screens and FE logic and 1 group can work on BE logic and DB part. Let me know if you have any questions.

We will be building an employee asset management system with two types of login, User Login(UL) and Department Login(DL)

Landing Screen : (for both UL & DL)

A simple page with a company logo(use Cognizant Logo) on the top left corner.

Username(should accept emp_Id or emp_email) and password fields(password field should mask the input).
Two buttons, one for User Login and another for Department Login.

User Login flow : 

Screen 1 : 

Divided into 3 panes.

Top half of the page is split into two panes and the bottom half of the page contains one pane.

Top Left pane should display the User profile  like Name, email ID, DOB, address information.
Top Right pane should display any info on the pending requests or issues reported on the assets. Pending requests should have a yellow background and issues should have a red font.

Bottom pane will list the assets(Laptop, Desktop, Monitor, keyboard, mouse, headphones, IP Phone) assigned to the employee.


Screen 2 : 
On click of the asset, the user will be taken to details page.

It will contain information regarding the Asset Id, Asset Name, Allocated since when, Allocation ending date, Renewal reminder date(one month before allocation ending date)

It should also contain a button to Release asset and Replace asset.
On click of Release asset, a confirmation dialog box appears, "Are you sure you want to release the asset?" with OK and Cancel buttons.

On click of Cancel, close the popup and on click of OK, the user should be shown the Screen 1 and the asset should be removed from the user.


Department Login Flow : 

Screen 1 : 

Top Row contains the following fields

A text box to enter user name(will filter results based on the user, when no input is given, considered as wildcard)
A drop down to select Asset type(Laptop, Desktop, Monitor, keyboard, mouse, headphones, IP Phone)
A drop down to select status (Pending, Assigned, Issues) (allow multiple selection)
A search button.

On click of button, display the results in a tabular format with the following fields.

Asset Name, Asset Status, Asset Type, Assigned To, Allocated since

On click of the asset, show the details page of Screen 2 : User login flow


Database design :

DOB
